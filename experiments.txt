Experimentation

Higher-order understanding of the low-level understanding dynamics (meta-learning):
    convergence - does it converge, to what, plateau
    generalization - does it overfit to the specific model subtleties or is it semantic
    2 player games - can it understand the lower player well enough
    clock time - actual, change in, reduce without performance hit

Prediction and encoding of dynamical systems
    Eigen value of W - understand the dynamics of it's model
    Can it encode non-random chaotic behavior
    What inner representations must be encoded for model - how well do they work,
    interpretability
    compressed library of observed states

    
Can conv nets and/or resnets get hierarchical representation for dyn. systems?
Non-trivial (semantic) adversarial competition

    
Don't know what to do about these...
    Deep learning for deep learning - statistical dynamical system meta-understanding
    Change from the inside - understanding while living in it
    phase-state change - meta-parameters like viscosity
    local-only observation
