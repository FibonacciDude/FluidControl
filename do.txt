rl framework for unsupervised attention choosing system rl
online algorithm
transformers
lifelong learning

how did the formalism for rl come about - proofs, theorems, intuition
develop new/old but rehashed/similar but subtly different formalism of what rl seeks to do
keep reading papers on computer

read up:
    read papers during school
    get to numerical methods and others for simulating fluids - read books
    dynamical systems book

reward funtion changing - inverse rl <-> higher + lower
optimal control of data -> lower dynamic process

factored dynamics - D(s)D(a|s)

dont forget:
    contrained manifold for active learning - unsupervised?
